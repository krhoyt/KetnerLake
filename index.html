      <p class="history">
        Toodles was originally built on top of blockchain as a demonstration of create, read, update, and delete operations with a custom contract.
        Some internal stakeholders thought a task management application had no place on blockchain, and the project recieved heavy resistance.
        My argument was two-fold.
        What more basic, trustless, interaction among people is there other than collaborative work that needs to get done?
        The "to-do" list, where Toodles gets its name, is a common example used by developers across countless technologies to understand basic architecture.
        As I showed Toodles at conferences around the world, the concept gained considerable traction as a teaching tool and became a feature project.
        These days Toodles lives on, not on blockchain, but as a browser-based application built on web components.
